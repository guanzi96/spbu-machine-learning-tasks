# spbu-machine-learning-tasks
This repository contains machine learning tasks for the SPBU course. 


# Homework Assignments
## Homework 1: Supervised Learning
- **Description**: The first machine learning assignment covering the application and comparison of regression and classification models. The assignment file contains detailed code and instructions to train, evaluate and draw conclusions about the models
- **branch**:hw1_cassification_regression_analysis
- **Solution**: [hw1_cassification _regression.ipynb](https://github.com/guanzi96/spbu-machine-learning-tasks/blob/hw1_cassification_regression_analysis/hw1_cassification%20_regression.ipynb)




## Homework 2: Performance optimisation of classification and regression models
- **Description**: This is the second machine learning assignment covering the application and comparison of regression and classification models. Eight different evaluation metrics for classification and regression models have been added. A grid search combined with cross-validation was used. The assignment file contains detailed code and instructions for training, evaluating and drawing conclusions about the models.
