# spbu-machine-learning-tasks
This repository contains machine learning tasks for the SPBU course. 


# Homework Assignments
## Homework 1: Supervised Learning
- **Description**: The first machine learning assignment covering the application and comparison of regression and classification models. The assignment file contains detailed code and instructions to train, evaluate and draw conclusions about the models
- **branch**:hw1_cassification_regression_analysis
- **Solution**: [hw1_cassification _regression.ipynb](https://github.com/guanzi96/spbu-machine-learning-tasks/blob/hw1_cassification_regression_analysis/hw1_cassification%20_regression.ipynb)




## Homework 2: Performance optimisation of classification and regression models
- **Description**: This is the second machine learning assignment covering the application and comparison of regression and classification models. Eight different evaluation metrics for classification and regression models have been added. A grid search combined with cross-validation was used. The assignment file contains detailed code and instructions for training, evaluating and drawing conclusions about the models.
- **branch**:hw2_classification_regression_metrics_grid_search
- **Solution**: [hw2_classification_regression_metrics_grid_search.ipynb](https://github.com/guanzi96/spbu-machine-learning-tasks/blob/hw2_classification_regression_metrics_grid_search/hw2_classification_regression_metrics_grid_search.ipynb)

## Homework 3: Realisation of the product quantisation algorithm
- **Description**: Chunking and clustering of high-dimensional data using a product quantisation algorithm. We generate cluster centres by partitioning the data vectors into multiple sub-vectors and using KMeans clustering in each sub-vector space, then quantize and reconstruct the data, and finally evaluate the reconstruction error.
- **Solution**: [hw3_product_quantization_realise.ipynb](https://github.com/guanzi96/spbu-machine-learning-tasks/blob/hw3_product_quantization/hw3_product_quantization_realise.ipynb)

## Homework 5: simulated search quality
- **Description**: This project simulates a multi-person labeling task. The goal is to explore different labeling aggregation methods, such as majority vote and Dawid-Skene, and to compare the two methods and give conclusions.
